    <ul>
      <li>A website dedicated to dragons and about the various mythos and lore behind them.</li>
      <li>We could make a website talking about AIS.</li>
      <li>We could make a website that talks about some specific species of animal, like the Black Bear or Chameleons.</li>
      <li>Maybe we could make a website about some subject in our school, like Math or English.</li>
